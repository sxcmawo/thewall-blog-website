Blog website using flask

This was a project for my Advanced Programming course at university.

For frontend there was used HTML5, Bootstrap/CSS, javascript

For backend Python framework Flask was used. I also utilized SQLAlchemy with sqlite to deal with the database part of a project.

The application provides an ability for a user to create an account and login whenever needed. The main feature of the website is creating posts that then appear in a feed of a website. Every post title and subtitle appears in a form of a card on the main page. The whole text of a post can be read on a separate page. Besides, a user can like and comment any post that was created. The same way users are able to unlike and delete their comments, also a creator of a post is able to delete any comments left on their post.
